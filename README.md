### About Me
Hello, my name is Carol, and I'm a software engineer with a deep passion for creating. My journey in programming began in college, where I studied computer science, and it further blossomed during an intensive bootcamp. This foundation has fueled my love for coding and problem-solving, allowing me to blend my technical expertise with my creative side.

I enjoy expressing my creativity not only through code but also through various art forms like digital design and painting. My goal is to refine my skills and contribute to projects that make a meaningful impact on people's lives. I'm always eager to collaborate with like-minded individuals and organizations that value both creativity and technical expertise.
